# Market Manus - Trading Automation System

## Overview
Market Manus is an automated trading system designed for scalping and swing trading using real-time market data from Binance.US. It integrates AI, advanced technical analysis (including Smart Money Concepts), and robust capital management to achieve a high win rate through intelligent signal confluence. The project aims to provide a professional-grade tool for automated trading with a focus on intelligent market analysis and strategic execution.

## Recent Changes (October 2025)
### Phase 1 Quick Corrections - COMPLETED âœ…
- **Directional Trading Signals**: All strategies (classic and SMC) now return BUY/SELL directional signals instead of generic "BUY" only. Confluence system uses `VoteData` class to aggregate directional votes with proper type safety.
- **SHORT Position Trading**: Paper trading simulator now supports SHORT positions with inverted SL/TP logic, enabling bidirectional backtesting.
- **Realistic SL/TP Evaluation**: Simulator uses high/low intrabar data to validate stop-loss and take-profit levels, with absolute priority for stop execution in case of gaps (when both SL/TP are touched in same candle).
- **Real OHLCV Data for SMC**: Removed fake `open=close` workaround, all SMC strategies now receive complete OHLCV data with real open prices.
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Reduced LSP errors from 21 to 8, with remaining errors being non-critical typing warnings.

## System Architecture
The system is a CLI/TUI application built with Python 3.11, structured around modular components for market analysis, strategy execution, and user interaction.

### UI/UX Decisions
The system features a professional-grade, real-time interactive console-based UI/UX. Key elements include:
- **Live Streaming Visualization**: A multi-panel layout (Header, Metrics, Optional Paper Trading, Body, Footer) provides real-time updates of market data, strategy signals, and performance metrics.
- **Alert System**: Visual highlights and optional audio alerts for strong signals, with dynamic UI changes to draw attention to critical events.
- **Paper Trading Simulator**: A virtual trade execution environment with real-time P&L, automatic Stop Loss/Take Profit, and comprehensive trade statistics.
- **Narrative UI**: Natural language presentation (in Portuguese) of market sentiment data, transforming technical indicators into contextual storytelling with progressive disclosure and dynamic adaptation to market conditions.
- **Rich Display**: Utilization of the `rich` library for advanced terminal UI rendering, including tables, panels, and color-coded status indicators.

### Technical Implementations
- **Core Architecture**: Features a modular design with components for market sentiment analysis, a diverse Strategy Lab (13 strategies including 5 Smart Money Concepts), Confluence Lab, Data Provider, and Capital Manager.
- **Market Sentiment Analysis**: A modular system aggregating data from various sources (Fear & Greed Index, CoinGecko, Bybit, CoinGlass, CryptoPanic, Santiment, Glassnode, Google Trends) to generate a composite "Market Prognosis." It includes dynamic asset resolution and news sentiment analysis.
- **ICT Framework v2.0**: A professional-grade implementation of Inner Circle Trader methodology, structured into four pillars: Market Structure (BOS, CHoCH, Order Blocks, Liquidity Sweep), Context (Regime Detection, FVG, Strength Scoring), Narrative (Liquidity, Killzones, HTF Context, Judas Swing), and Setup (Entry Models, SL/TP, Setup Scoring). An orchestrator manages sequential analysis and filtering.
- **Confluence System**: Combines SMC detectors with 10 classic technical strategies (including 3 new scalping-optimized detectors: MA Ribbon, Momentum Combo, Pivot Points). It uses a weighted scoring engine with regime filters and conflict penalties for high-probability signal generation.
- **Market Context Analyzer**: A regime detection system that analyzes historical data (MA slope, ADX, ATR) to identify BULLISH, BEARISH, or CORRECTION conditions, auto-adjusting strategy weights for context-aware execution.
- **Volume Filter Pipeline**: Implements statistical volume-based signal filtering using Z-scores to reject low-volume signals and amplify high-volume ones, applied after strategy signals but before confluence scoring.
- **Data Handling**: Features unlimited historical data fetching via intelligent batching, a Parquet-based caching system for historical data, and robust real-time data streaming via Binance.US WebSocket with automatic reconnection and exponential backoff.
- **Strategy Execution**: RealtimeStrategyEngine supports parallel execution of all selected strategies (`asyncio.gather()`) for low latency. Signals are standardized using a `Signal` dataclass.
- **Scalping Mode**: A configurable preset optimizing parameters for short timeframes (1m-5m) with specific indicator settings and adjusted weights.
- **Strategy Explanations**: Comprehensive documentation (Markdown files) for all 13 strategies covering logic, triggers, parameters, and best practices.

### Feature Specifications
- **Strategy Lab V6**: Offers 13 professional trading strategies (8 classic, 5 SMC) with real-time and historical testing capabilities, including API key validation and detailed metrics display.
- **Confluence Lab**: Supports combining strategies using ALL, MAJORITY, WEIGHTED, and ANY modes, with real-time execution displaying live confluence signals.
- **Supported Timeframes**: Ranges from 1 minute to 1 day for flexible analysis and trading.
