The project aims to provide a professional-grade tool for automated trading with a focus on intelligent market analysis and strategic execution.

## Recent Changes (October 2025)
### Phase 1 Quick Corrections - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- **Directional Trading Signals**: All strategies (classic and SMC) now return BUY/SELL directional signals instead of generic "BUY" only. Confluence system uses `VoteData` class to aggregate directional votes with proper type safety.
- **SHORT Position Trading**: Paper trading simulator now supports SHORT positions with inverted SL/TP logic, enabling bidirectional backtesting.
- **Realistic SL/TP Evaluation**: Simulator uses high/low intrabar data to validate stop-loss and take-profit levels, with absolute priority for stop execution in case of gaps (when both SL/TP are touched in same candle).
- **Real OHLCV Data for SMC**: Removed fake `open=close` workaround, all SMC strategies now receive complete OHLCV data with real open prices.
- **Type Safety Improvements**: Reduced LSP errors from 21 to 8, with remaining errors being non-critical typing warnings.

### Phase 2 ICT Enhancements & Trading Costs - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- **OTE (Optimal Trade Entry)**: Implemented fibonacci-based entry zones (62%, 70.5%, 79% retracements) for precision entries in narrative.py. Calculates bullish/bearish OTE zones with optimal entry bands for high-probability setups.
- **CE (Consequent Encroachment)**: Added midpoint (50%) calculation for ranges as target zones and decision levels. Used for partial profit targets and retest entries in ICT methodology.
- **Premium/Discount Zones**: Full implementation of value area classification dividing ranges into 5 zones (Premium High 75-100%, Premium Med 50-75%, Equilibrium 45-55%, Discount Med 25-45%, Discount Low 0-25%). Provides directional bias (premium favors SHORT, discount favors LONG) with automatic price classification.
- **Narrative Enrichment**: `enrich_narrative_with_ote_ce()` helper adds OTE/CE/Premium-Discount data to MarketNarrative.meta with confluence-based strength adjustments (e.g., Discount + OTE Bullish increases signal strength).
- **FeeModel Class**: Professional trading cost simulator in capital_manager.py with configurable maker/taker fees and slippage. Three presets available: LIVE (Binance 0.1%/0.1% + 0.05% slippage), CONSERVATIVE (0.15%/0.15% + 0.2% slippage), OPTIMISTIC (0.075%/0.075% + 0% slippage). Correctly applies slippage only to taker orders (market orders), not maker orders (limit orders).
- **Cost Calculation Methods**: `calculate_entry_cost()`, `calculate_exit_cost()`, `calculate_total_trade_cost()`, and `apply_costs_to_pnl()` for accurate net P&L computation with separate maker/taker handling.
- **ConfluenceEngineAdapter**: Created adapter pattern mapping current strategies to ConfluenceEngine detector interface for future migration (migration deferred to avoid large refactoring).
- **Bug Fixes**: Corrected Premium/Discount equilibrium classification (45%-55% now properly neutral), fixed slippage application (taker-only), and improved type safety across codebase.

### Phase 2 Visual Transparency Features - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- **ICT Market Context Panel**: Real-time visual display showing Premium/Discount classification (color-coded: red for Premium, green for Discount, yellow for Equilibrium), current price zone, active OTE status (BULLISH/BEARISH), and CE level (50% midpoint). Integrated into live streaming UI for immediate market context awareness.
- **Trading Costs Panel**: Transparent breakdown of paper trading performance displaying current equity, position status (open/closed), unrealized P&L, and detailed last trade analysis showing Gross P&L ‚Üí Trading Costs (fees+slippage) ‚Üí Net P&L. Win rate with total trades count provides confidence metrics.
- **Enhanced StreamState**: Expanded state tracking to include ICT narrative data (ict_premium_discount, ict_ote_active, ict_ote_type, ict_ce_level, ict_price_in_zone) and paper trading metrics (paper_equity, paper_position_open, paper_unrealized_pnl, paper_last_trade_gross/costs/net, paper_win_rate, paper_total_trades).
- **Live Data Integration**: Automatic extraction of ICT data from signal.meta['narrative'] and paper trading metrics from engine.state, ensuring real-time accuracy with safe attribute checking and fallback values.
- **Color-Coded Transparency**: Intuitive visual feedback using green for profitable/bullish conditions, red for losses/bearish, and yellow for neutral/equilibrium states across all panels.

### Phase 2 Historical Data Caching System - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- **HistoricalDataCache Integration**: Fully integrated Parquet-based caching system in both Confluence Lab and Strategy Lab V6, drastically reducing API calls by storing historical data locally in `data/` directory (C:\Users\Esdras\scalping-trading-system\data).
- **Cache-First Architecture**: Modified `_fetch_historical_klines()` in both modules to check cache BEFORE making API calls. Cache HIT returns stored data instantly with visual feedback ("‚úÖ Cache HIT: {cache_key}"), while Cache MISS triggers API fetch followed by automatic cache save ("üì• Cache MISS: buscando API...").
- **Session Statistics Tracking**: Added `cache_stats` dictionary tracking hits, misses, and API calls saved per session, providing transparency on cache efficiency.
- **CLI Cache Management Menu**: New "üìÅ Dados Hist√≥ricos Salvos" menu option (option 6Ô∏è‚É£ in Confluence Lab, option 9Ô∏è‚É£ in Strategy Lab) with 4 submenu options:
  * üìä Ver dados salvos (Rich Table: s√≠mbolo, interval, per√≠odo, candles, tamanho, data)
  * üóëÔ∏è Limpar cache espec√≠fico (select by number)
  * üßπ Limpar todo cache (with confirmation)
  * üìà Estat√≠sticas de uso (files, space, hits/misses)
- **Metadata Management**: Automatic cache metadata tracking in `cache_metadata.json` including symbol, interval, date range, candle count, file size, and cache timestamp.
- **Smart Key Generation**: Unique cache keys based on symbol+interval+start_date+end_date ensuring precise cache matching and avoiding stale data issues.
