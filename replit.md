# Market Manus - Trading Automation System

## Overview
Market Manus is an automated trading system for scalping and swing trading, utilizing real-time market data from Binance.US. It integrates AI, advanced technical analysis (including Smart Money Concepts), and robust capital management to achieve a high win rate through intelligent signal confluence. The project aims to provide a professional-grade tool for automated trading with a focus on intelligent market analysis and strategic execution, providing a comprehensive solution for automated market analysis and trade execution.

## User Preferences
I prefer to receive comprehensive and detailed explanations, ensuring a thorough understanding of all concepts and decisions. Please do not make changes to the `data/` folder, as it is reserved for historical data caching. Additionally, refrain from modifying files within the `config/` directory without explicit instructions, as these contain sensitive configuration settings.

## System Architecture
The system offers dual interfaces (CLI/Web) built with Python 3.11, structured around modular components for market analysis, strategy execution, and user interaction. Users can choose their preferred interface at startup via `python main.py`.

### Dual Interface System
- **CLI Mode**: Professional-grade terminal interface with real-time visualization using the `rich` library
- **Web Interface**: Modern browser-based dashboard with responsive design and real-time updates
- **Startup Selection**: Interactive menu allows choosing between CLI or Web interface at launch
- **Shared Backend**: Both interfaces utilize the same core trading engine and modules

### UI/UX Decisions

#### CLI/TUI Interface
The CLI features a professional-grade, real-time interactive console-based UI/UX with a multi-panel layout for live streaming visualization, including a Header, Metrics, optional Paper Trading panel, Body, and Footer. It incorporates an alert system with visual highlights and optional audio for strong signals. A paper trading simulator offers a virtual execution environment with real-time P&L, automatic Stop Loss/Take Profit, and trade statistics. The Narrative UI presents market sentiment data in natural language (Portuguese) using progressive disclosure. The `rich` library is utilized for advanced terminal UI rendering, including tables, panels, and color-coded status indicators.

- **ICT Framework v2.0**: A professional-grade implementation of Inner Circle Trader methodology structured around Market Structure, Context, Narrative, and Setup.
- **Confluence System**: Combines SMC detectors with 12 classic technical strategies. It features a weighted scoring engine with regime filters and conflict penalties, offering 22 Professional Recommended Combinations organized by market condition.
- **Market Context Analyzer**: A regime detection system that analyzes historical data to identify BULLISH, BEARISH, or CORRECTION conditions, adjusting strategy weights accordingly.
- **Volume Filter Pipeline**: Implements statistical volume-based signal filtering using Z-scores.
- **Data Handling**: Features unlimited historical data fetching via intelligent batching, a Parquet-based caching system for historical data, and robust real-time data streaming via Binance.US WebSocket.
- **Strategy Execution**: RealtimeStrategyEngine supports parallel execution of all selected strategies (`asyncio.gather()`) for low latency.
- **Scalping Mode**: A configurable preset optimizing parameters for short timeframes (1m-5m).

### Feature Specifications
